Next.js / TypeScript / Tailwind / FramerMotion Library

CV / Portfolio App

This app was inspired by Sonny Sangha's tutorial, but I have made significant improvements by removing minor bugs and redesigning the layout for better responsiveness, which was lacking in the original version.

Throughout the development process, I learned new tricks with Tailwind CSS and implemented other best practices to enhance the app's responsiveness and efficiency.

The main cahhange I encountered was particularly with the mobile viewport height, which includes the additional address or navigation bar. However, I learned a JavaScript workaround and also discovered newly implemented mobile viewport units such as dvh, lvh, and svh.
