IN DEVELOPMENT

I used Sonny Sangha's tutorial as a starting point to create this app, but I have since modified and improved it to better suit my needs. Throughout this process, I learned new tricks with Tailwind and implemented other best practices to make the app more responsive and efficient.

Please note that this is only a draft version, and I plan to make significant improvements and personalize it further to align with my preferences.
